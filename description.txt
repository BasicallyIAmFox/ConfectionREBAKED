===========================================
Confection REBAKED (Alternate Hallowed mod)
===========================================
The Confection Uses Alternate Libraries mod to be able to be compatible with other alternate biome mods

This is still a version of confection which is in active delopment so if there is any bugs you have found please report in our discord.

Even though the 1.3 version is discontinued we would still recomend you use the 1.3 version.
As of this version of the confection the confection should now be completable.
