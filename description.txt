===========================================
Confection REBAKED (ALPHA)
===========================================
This this a snapshot of the upcoming confection update for tmodloader 1.4

This uses the Alternate Biome Library mod which was made by our team to allow future alternate biomes work together.

Currently it is very unstable and unbalance as well as a few features missing completely
WOULD RECOMEND USING THE 1.3 VERSION UNTIL THIS ONE IS STABLE

The trees do look a little weird, THIS IS A BUG WITH TMODLOADER NOT WITH THE CONFECTION.
