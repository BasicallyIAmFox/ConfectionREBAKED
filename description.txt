Confection REBAKED (Alternate Hallowed mod)
===========================================
The Confection Uses Alternate Libraries mod to be able to be compatible with other alternate biome mods

You are 100% able to port 1.3 confection worlds to 1.4 tmodloader ALTHOUGH your world will turn to being hallowed as registration for worlds being confection or not are different in 1.4 due to altlib.
